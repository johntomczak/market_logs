# market_logs

this is my first attempt at formalizing and centralizing my financial data analysis

	FILES (each will get a quick description as they are added):

	1. daily_logs.xlsx: 
		- main collection of daily data pulls
		- equities, commodities, FX, fixed income, CME FedWatch, economic data, and my holdings
		- updated "once a day," but realistically once or twice a week
